### Introduction
My name is Victoria Nguyen. I am a third year ECE student
interested in specializing in either **computing, Digital Systems Design, or computer architecture**. I am hoping to figure it out by the end of this school year based on the classes that I am taking.

Some of my goals this quarter include:
- getting good grades in my courses
- learning new skills
- applying to many internships
- being productive
- being physically active

In my spare time, I like to listen to music, play games, read books, and build legos. There's a lot of other hobbies but these are the most prevalent at the moment.
